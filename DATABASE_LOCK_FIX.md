# Database Lock Issue Fix

## Problem
The application was showing database lock warnings:
```
Warning database has been locked for 0:00:10.000000. Make sure you always use the transaction object for database operations during a transaction
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Category services (MainCategoryService and SubCategoryService) were using database transactions
2. When toggling category status, they called ProductService cascade methods
3. The cascade methods were using the main database connection (`db`) instead of the transaction object (`txn`)
4. This caused database locks as both the transaction and the main connection tried to access the database simultaneously

## Solution
Updated the cascade methods in ProductService to accept an optional transaction parameter:

### 1. Modified ProductService Methods
```dart
// Before
Future<void> handleMainCategoryCascade(int mainCategoryId, bool isActive) async {
  final db = await _dbHelper.database;
  // ... operations using db
}

// After
Future<void> handleMainCategoryCascade(
  int mainCategoryId,
  bool isActive, {
  Transaction? txn,
}) async {
  final db = txn ?? await _dbHelper.database;
  // ... operations using db (which is now txn when provided)
}
```

### 2. Updated Service Calls
```dart
// MainCategoryService
await _productService.handleMainCategoryCascade(id, false, txn: txn);

// SubCategoryService
await _productService.handleSubCategoryCascade(id, isActive, txn: txn);
```

### 3. Added Required Import
```dart
import 'package:sqflite_common/sqlite_api.dart'; // For Transaction type
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates database lock warnings
- ✅ Ensures atomic operations across categories and products
- ✅ Maintains data consistency during cascading updates
- ✅ Proper transaction management
- ✅ Backwards compatible (methods can still be called without transaction)

## How It Works
1. When category services start a transaction, they pass the transaction object to product cascade methods
2. Product cascade methods use the provided transaction instead of creating a new database connection
3. All operations happen within the same transaction, avoiding lock conflicts
4. If no transaction is provided, methods fall back to using the main database connection

## Test Results
- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ No database lock warnings
- ✅ Category cascading works correctly
- ✅ Product status updates work as expected
- ✅ Data integrity maintained

The database lock issue has been completely resolved!
